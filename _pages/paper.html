      			<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">The impact of congressional support or opposition to the use of military force on executive intervention decisions is debated in political science, history, and law. The Imperial Presidency thesis argues that Congress has little influence, but historians suggest that congressional sentiment is important in individual cases. However, measuring congressional sentiment is challenging because lawmakers avoid taking recorded votes. A new dataset called the Congressional Support for the Use of Military Force (CSUMF) uses floor speeches to measure sentiment towards military force from 1945 to the present. It includes overall sentiment, political party breakdown, and dynamic scores that allow for variation within a crisis over time. The dataset is a superior proxy to other measures such as congressional composition or presidential copartisans.</p>
